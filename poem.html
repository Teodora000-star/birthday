        <p>In our Discord realm, where laughter's queen,
            Angie reigns with charm, like none we've seen.
            Her confidence shines, a guiding light,
            A goddess in our digital night.
            
            With wit and humor, she holds the stage,
            Where jokes about boobs, become the rage.
            Yet beneath the banter, a heart so true,
            Always there for me and you.
            
            Angie, on your special day,
            Let's celebrate in our own playful way.
            Like Gojo, tall and bold,
            You stand out, a sight to behold.
            
            Here's to laughter, friendship's true bliss,
            In every joke, and every playful tease.
            Happy Birthday, dear Angie,
            You're the goddess of our hearts, eternally.</p>
